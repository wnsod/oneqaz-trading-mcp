### Connect from Claude

#### Live API (recommended — no install needed)

Connect directly to our 24/7 live server with real-time market data:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oneqaz-trading": {
      "url": "https://api.oneqaz.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Local (self-hosted with sample data)

If you prefer to run locally with demo data:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oneqaz-trading": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8010/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Ask Claude about market conditions

Once connected, just ask Claude in natural language:

```
You: "What's the current market regime for crypto?"

Claude reads market://crypto/status and responds:
  "Crypto is currently in a sideways_bullish regime.
   Fear & Greed index is at 68 (Greed).
   3 active BUY signals with avg score 0.78."
```

```
You: "Show me the best performing positions in US stocks"

Claude calls get_positions(market_id="us_stock", sort_by="roi", sort_order="desc") and responds:
  "Top positions:
   1. NVDA — +12.3% ROI (trend_continuation strategy)
   2. AAPL — +8.1% ROI (breakout strategy)
   3. MSFT — +5.4% ROI (momentum strategy)"
```

```
You: "Any macro risks I should know about?"

Claude reads market://global/summary and responds:
  "Global regime: neutral (score: 0.12)
   - Bonds: bearish, rising yields
   - VIX: elevated, risk_level=high
   - Commodities: bullish, gold at ATH
   Recommendation: defensive positioning suggested."
```

### 2. Build an AI trading assistant

Connect the MCP server to your own AI application:

```python
# Your AI app reads market intelligence from OneQAZ
regime = mcp.read("market://crypto/status")
signals = mcp.call("get_signals", market_id="crypto", min_score=0.7)
fear_greed = mcp.read("market://indicators/fear-greed")

# Your AI decides what to do with this context
prompt = f"""
  Market regime: {regime}
  High-confidence signals: {signals}
  Sentiment: {fear_greed}

  Should the user buy, hold, or sell?
"""
```

### 3. Cross-market analysis

```
You: "Compare crypto vs US stock market conditions"

Claude reads:
  - market://crypto/status
  - market://us_stock/status
  - market://unified/cross-market

Claude: "Crypto is bullish while US stocks are neutral.
   Cross-market correlation is weakening — crypto is
   decoupling from equity risk sentiment.
   This pattern historically precedes crypto outperformance."
```

### 4. Signal monitoring

```
You: "What BUY signals fired in the last 24 hours for Korean stocks?"

Claude calls get_signals(market_id="kr_stock", action_filter="BUY"):
  "12 BUY signals in KR market:
   - Samsung (005930): score 0.85, trend_continuation
   - SK Hynix (000660): score 0.79, breakout
   - POSCO (005490): score 0.71, mean_reversion
   ..."
```

## Sample Response

Reading `market://crypto/status` returns:

```json
{
  "market_id": "crypto",
  "regime": {
    "stage": "sideways_bullish",
    "score": 0.42,
    "confidence": 0.78
  },
  "positions": {
    "total": 5,
    "long": 4,
    "short": 1,
    "avg_roi": 3.2
  },
  "signals_24h": {
    "buy": 8,
    "sell": 3,
    "hold": 12,
    "avg_score": 0.65
  },
  "_llm_summary": "Crypto market is sideways_bullish. 5 active positions (avg ROI +3.2%). 8 BUY signals in last 24h."
}
```
