## Why OneQAZ

Financial data APIs are everywhere. Market *intelligence* is not.

| | Typical financial MCP | OneQAZ |
|---|---|---|
| Price / OHLCV data | ✅ | ✅ |
| Technical indicators | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Regime detection** (trending / ranging / volatile) | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Self-correcting signals** (weighted by real outcomes) | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Macro → ETF → Individual context chain** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Live 24/7 cloud API** | ❌ | ✅ |

Signal weights are adjusted continuously based on actual trade outcomes
per regime via Thompson Sampling — not static indicator thresholds.
Every response includes an `_llm_summary` field optimized for AI consumption.

## What your AI gets

- **Regime detection**: Is the market trending, ranging, or volatile? Per-market and global
- **Self-correcting signals**: 1,100+ symbols scored by Thompson Sampling on actual trade outcomes
- **Macro context chain**: Global regime → bonds/forex/VIX/commodities → ETF/basket → individual symbol
- **External context**: News events, fundamentals, cross-market correlation — pre-processed for LLM consumption
- **19 Resources + 4 Tools**: Stateless HTTP, compatible with any MCP client
- **`_llm_summary` on every response**: Human-readable text summary optimized for AI agent context windows

### Market Coverage

| Market | Exchange | Universe | Symbols |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Crypto | Bithumb | All listed pairs | ~440+ |
| Korean Stocks | KOSPI/KOSDAQ | KOSPI 200 | ~200 |
| US Stocks | NYSE/NASDAQ | S&P 500 | ~500 |

All symbols are monitored 24/7 with automated signal generation, regime detection, and virtual trading.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Live API — no install needed

Real-time data, updated every minute.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oneqaz-trading": {
      "url": "https://api.oneqaz.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Ask Claude: *"What's the current market regime?"*

### Option 2: Local (demo data)

```bash
pip install oneqaz-trading-mcp
oneqaz-trading-mcp init    # creates sample SQLite databases
oneqaz-trading-mcp serve   # starts at http://localhost:8010
```

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8010/docs`
- MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:8010/mcp`

Then connect from Claude:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oneqaz-trading": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8010/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Give your AI agent market awareness

Connect OneQAZ and your agent understands market context without you building the pipeline:

```python
# Your agent reads regime + signals + macro in one call
context = mcp.read("market://crypto/unified")

# Or go granular
regime = mcp.read("market://crypto/status")          # what phase is the market in?
signals = mcp.call("get_signals", market_id="crypto", min_score=0.7)  # what's working now?
macro = mcp.read("market://global/summary")           # what's driving this from above?

# Feed to your agent's decision layer
prompt = f"""
  Regime: {regime}
  High-confidence signals: {signals}
  Macro context: {macro}

  Recommend portfolio action.
"""
```

### 2. Build a regime-aware trading system

Your AI reacts differently based on market state — no hardcoded rules:

```python
regime = mcp.read("market://us_stock/status")
structure = mcp.read("market://us_stock/structure")

if regime["regime"]["stage"] == "volatile":
    signals = mcp.call("get_signals", market_id="us_stock", action_filter="DEFENSIVE")
else:
    signals = mcp.call("get_signals", market_id="us_stock", min_score=0.7)
```

### 3. Cross-market macro→micro analysis

Trace how macro shifts flow into individual assets:

```python
# Macro layer
global_regime = mcp.read("market://global/summary")
bonds = mcp.read("market://global/category/bonds")

# Cross-market correlation
cross = mcp.read("market://unified/cross-market")

# Down to individual symbol with full context chain
symbol_ctx = mcp.read("market://us_stock/unified/symbol/NVDA")
```

### 4. Ask Claude directly

Already using Claude? Just connect and ask:

```
"What's the current market regime for crypto?"
"Show me the best performing positions in US stocks"
"Any macro risks I should know about?"
"Compare crypto vs US stock conditions"
```

## Sample Response

Reading `market://crypto/status` returns:

```json
{
  "market_id": "crypto",
  "regime": {
    "stage": "sideways_bullish",
    "score": 0.42,
    "confidence": 0.78
  },
  "positions": {
    "total": 5,
    "long": 4,
    "short": 1,
    "avg_roi": 3.2
  },
  "signals_24h": {
    "buy": 8,
    "sell": 3,
    "hold": 12,
    "avg_score": 0.65
  },
  "_llm_summary": "Crypto market is sideways_bullish. 5 active positions (avg ROI +3.2%). 8 BUY signals in last 24h."
}
```

## Rate Limits

The live API (`api.oneqaz.com/mcp`) has rate limits to ensure fair usage:

| Limit | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Daily quota | 1,500 requests/IP | Resets every 24 hours |
| Burst limit | 30 requests/min/IP | Prevents overloading |

**What this means:**
- Monitor 2-3 symbols all day: ~500-800 requests → no problem
- Scan entire market once: ~1,200-1,500 requests → fits in daily quota
- Exceeding limits returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header

**Response headers** on every request:
- `X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining`: requests left today
- `X-RateLimit-Minute-Remaining`: requests left this minute

Local self-hosted servers (`localhost`) have no rate limits.
